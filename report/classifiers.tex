\section{Alternatives to Naive Bayes}
As a classifier is modeld after some given assumptions and with specific architechtural properities, e.g. all attributes are equally important, it is important to check if the used classifier is the right model for the examined problem.
A very good feature of the Naive Bayes classifier is its ability to train on a dataset with a very high dimensionality in decent time.
Because this property is not shared among all other classifier and some even severely suffer from high dimensionality \todo{cite curse of D paper}, we are using the reduced set of features we estimated in the feature selection process without further research on the impact of other thresholds on feature trimming w.r.t. to non-bayesian classifiers.

\subsection{Decision Trees}

We are going to use Weka's \cite{hall2009weka} implementation of the C4.5 decision tree \cite{Quinlan1993} (known in Weka as J48) as the first alternative to Naive Bayes classification.
