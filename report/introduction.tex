\section{Introduction}
The following report describes our implementation of a spam filter.
\todo{This filter classifies emails by their content if they are unwanted (spam) mails or wanted (ham) mails using various preprocessing techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier.}

As we were only given a labelled training set, we are evaluating the performance of our classifier using 10-fold cross validation.
For each fold we are calculating the accuracy and reporting as a final measure the overall averaged accuracy and the sample standard deviation to compare the different classifier instantiations.

To optimise the classification performance, we pre-process the input data using various techniques to filter out noise, normalise the features and minimise the overall dimensionality.

As there is no one best classifier, we are comparing different classifiers for the given training set using different parameter instantiations.
