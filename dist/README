Building
========

The sources in this directory can be build using

javac -cp deps.jar *.java

All thirdparty dependencies are pacackged in deps.jar, these are:

 * Apache Commons Codecs
 * Google Gson
 * jsoup HTML Parser

Running
======

The code can be run using

java filter <email-file>

The code will take care by itself that the deps.jar file is loaded into
the classpath.

Remark
======

As not all files are required for running and we did not ship Weka
as a dependency, we "commented out" these files by renaming them to
"*.java_". These were used to compare J48 with our classifier but are
not needed for the final spam classification.
